# Privacy Policy - Infinity for Reddit

#### Last updated: Jan 11, 2020

I (Docile-Alligator) built the app, Infinity for Reddit ("Application" or "App"), as an Open Source app. This app is provided by me at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my app, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

I reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. I will alert you about any changes by updating the “Last updated” date of this Privacy Policy. You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Application after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the third-party online/mobile store from which you install the Application or make payments, including any in-app virtual items, which may also collect and use data about you. I am not responsible for any of the data collected by any such third party.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS THE APPLICATION.

## Information Collection and Use

### Log Data
I want to inform you that whenever you use my app, in a case of an error in the app, Google Play Services on your phone collect data called Log Data. The Log Data are then sent to my Google Play Console for debugging use. These Log Data include: your device model, your device's Android version, this app's version, the error stack trace and the time when the error happens. Non of the data are personally identifiable, which means I will not know who you are. Other data such as your name and email address, etc are not collected by Google Play Services, thus I cannot see them on Google Play Console.

## Other Services

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on these links, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these services. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Other APIs
This app uses two other public APIs: Gfycat and Imgur. If you click on these links, you will be directed to that site or the app will directly show the media using their public APIs. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these services. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party APIs.

## Security

I value your trust in using my app, thus I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
