<p><strong>Infinity for Reddit</strong> has zero tolerance for content or interactions that involve the sexual exploitation or abuse of minors. While our app does not host or store content directly, it enables access to Reddit’s platform through their official API. All content displayed in Infinity for Reddit originates from Reddit and is subject to Reddit’s policies and enforcement measures.</p>
<h3 id="our-commitment-to-child-safety">Our Commitment to Child Safety</h3>
<p><strong>Infinity for Reddit</strong> follows Reddit’s strict policies prohibiting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any sexual or suggestive content involving minors (under 18 years<br>
old)</li>
<li>Any attempts to solicit, distribute, or engage in predatory behavior<br>
towards minors</li>

<h3 id="how-child-sexual-exploitation-content-is-handled">How Child Sexual Exploitation Content Is Handled</h3>
<p>Since all content in Infinity for Reddit is provided through Reddit’s API, we rely on Reddit’s enforcement mechanisms to detect and remove such violations. Reddit utilizes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Industry-leading hash-matching technology (e.g., PhotoDNA, YouTube<br>
CSAI Match) to detect and remove known child sexual abuse material<br>
(CSAM).</li>
<li>Automated content detection methods to identify high-risk<br>
interactions that could lead to child exploitation.</li>
<li>Reports from child safety organizations like the National Center for<br>
Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).</li>
<li>User reporting mechanisms to flag inappropriate content for review<br>
and removal.</li>
</ul>
<p>When Reddit detects CSAM, they immediately remove the content, ban the violating accounts, and report it to law enforcement as required by law.</p>
